# Draggable Navball

Draggable Navball is a small mod for Kerbal Space Program. It does exactly
what it says on the tin: Allows you to drag the navball somewhere more
convenient than its default position directly under your rocket.

The ball's position will be remembered across scenes and game restarts. Note
that the UI\_POS\_NAVBALL option in settings.cfg is ignored while using
Draggable Navball.
